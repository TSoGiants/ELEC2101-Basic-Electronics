## Course Description
An introduction to basic electricity and the fundamentals of electrical engineering. Throughout this course, you will study, analyze, and simulate a variety of practical circuits, as well as optionally construct the circuits if you have the instrumentation and components available to you. Students who have completed this course should understand the basics of electronics instrumentation and be able to perform circuit analysis on simple circuits involving passive components, semiconductor devices, and some common integrated circuits.

----
## Lesson Plan

1. Simple Ohmic Circuits
2. Kirchhoff's Laws and the Node Voltage Method
3. The Mesh Current Method and Circuit Analysis Practice
4. *additional lessons will be added during course development*

----
